\chapter{Design Patterns}

\section{Creational}
Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation
mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object
creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns
solve this problem by controlling this object creation.

\subsection{Abstract Factory}
The Abstract Factory design pattern adds another layer of abstraction to the Factory design pattern.
The Abstract Factory provides us with a framework that allows us to create families of related or
dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. So at runtime, the abstract factory is
coupled with any desired factory which can create objects of desired type.

\section{Structural}
Structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to
realize relationships between entities.

\subsection{Bridge}
The Bridge design pattern allows us to separate the abstraction from the implementation, thus
allowing us to hide the implementation from the client and only providing the abstraction.
Use when:
\begin{itemize}
	\item we want run-time binding of the implementation
	\item we have a collection of related classes resulting from a coupled interface and numerous
	      implementations
	\item we want to share an implementation among multiple objects
	\item we need to map orthogonal class hierarchies
\end{itemize}
